## How to Differentiate STAC Files

Any tool that crawls a STAC implementation or encounters a STAC file in the wild needs a clear way to determine if it is an Item, 
Collection or Catalog. As of 1.0.0 this is done primarily
with the `type` field, and secondarily in Items with `stac_version`, or optionally with the `rel` of the link to it.

```shell
if type is 'Collection'
  => Collection
else if type is 'Catalog'
  => Catalog
else if type is 'Feature' and stac_version is defined
  => Item
else
  => Invalid (JSON)
```

When crawling a STAC implementation, one can also make use of the [relation type](catalog-spec/catalog-spec.md#relation-types
) (`rel` field) when following a link. If it is an `item` rel type then the file must be a STAC Item. If it is `child`, `parent` or
`root` then it must be a Catalog or a Collection, though the final determination between the two requires looking at the `type` field
in the Catalog or Collection JSON that it is linked to. Note that there is also a `type` field in STAC Link and Asset objects, but that
is for the Media Type, but there are not specific media types for Catalog and Collection.
See the sections on [STAC media types](commons/links.md#stac-media-types),
and [Asset media types](commons/assets.md#media-types) for more information.

In versions of STAC prior to 1.0 the process was a bit more complicated, as there was no `type` field for catalogs and collections.
See [this issue comment](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues/889#issuecomment-684529444) for a heuristic that works
for older STAC versions.
